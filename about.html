                    <p>Aloha, and welcome to Nice Dude, a beach-friendly company since 1820.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here at Nice Dude, we love surfing, and decided to support our radical
                        wave-riding friends with overpriced affordable subscriptions. For just a
                        few dollars a month, you can get exclusive mystery items that will have you set for a gnarly
                        time in the water.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our goal since the start has been the evolution of the surfing
                        community. Our founder, Tobias Howard, was a young Englishman who discovered surfing
                        when he stumbled across Hawaiian surfers on his vacation to their territory. Their
                        absolutely mental skills convinced Tobias to invest in their livelihood, and since then we have
                        been dedicated to providing supplies for up-and-coming grommets, using
                        random boxes full of equipment that will make you as stylish
                        as Duke Kahanamoku himself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What are you waiting for? It's time to bail your average surf shop and join the
                        world's #1 surfing subscription service! Be the kahuna of your local beach!
